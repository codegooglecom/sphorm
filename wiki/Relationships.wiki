To be able to use One to One relationship, you need to let know Sphorm who is your domain's brother. In this case you need to add a static array, named 'hasOne' like this:
{{{
static $hasOne = array(
	  'profile' => array(                 // property name, $obj->profile
		'type' => 'Profile',          // it's type, $obj->profile = new Profile()
		'join' => 'ProfileUserID'     // Join column, aka FK
	  )
	);
}}}
