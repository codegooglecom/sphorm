Q: What's sphorm?
A: Simple PHP ORM

Q: Why?
A: Inspired by other dynamic languages, we want to bring fun to PHP world.

Q: It's a small project, do you really need 4 numbers in sphorm's version?
A: So far we think that Yes. They mean:
  * major - some major changes, perhaps rewritten most of it (not planned soon)
  * minor - new features for some specific tasks probably. Expect API changes.
  * micro - improvements, cleanups. No API change.
  * bugfix - bug fixes. Instead of making a cumulative release, there would be many smaller.
