Q: Why?<br>

Q: It's a small project, do you really need 4 numbers in sphorm's version?<br>
A: So far we think that Yes. They mean:<br>
<ul><li>major - some major changes, perhaps rewritten most of it (not planned soon)<br>
</li><li>minor - new features for some specific tasks probably. Expect API changes.<br>
</li><li>micro - improvements, cleanups. No API change.<br>
</li><li>bugfix - bug fixes. Instead of making a cumulative release, there would be many smaller.<br></li></ul>

Q: How can I contribute?<br>
A: Use sphorm and give us your feedback. Bug reports, suggestions are always welcome.
